# Reduse
### Introduction
Frankly it is just acronym for reactive redis url shortener with bunches of additional word, just made it more brand-like name!

### Note
I do not have Docker, so you may find error in docker-compose or Dockerfile; anyway i just used my god-like imaginary!

You have two api path
* /compact : you send url with PUT and json body then you got json result whom contain the shortened link.
* /extract?key=shortened-url : you got the shortened url from compact path then you can use it as query param and retrieve the original one!
